# General Lode-Viewer Notes:
A collection of notes regarding the use of the Lode-Viewer.

## Updating Core.root string:
Depending on your project's requirements, you may need to update your Core.root string which is defined in the application's main.js file. For example, the default, `Core.root = "./";` but in the context of [Lode-Viewer](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2020014-eng.htm) the `Core.root = "./2020014/";`.
